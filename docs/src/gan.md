# GAN

In this repository, we have included a folder with different generative adversarial networks, GANs: [vanilla GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf), [WGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07875.pdf), [MMD-GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.08584.pdf).

In the first two cases, we have used the implementation from https://github.com/AdarshKumar712/FluxGAN, with some minor changes, and in the last case, we have rewritten the original code written in Python to Julia.
